The IWI is an internationally standardized wealth index which calculates wealth in terms of assets based on household surveys. This model extrapolated survey results in Nepal to non-surveyed areas based on phone records and top-up patterns, night lights, census data and other factors which were shown to have a proven relationship to observed household charactersitics in the available survey data.

The sum, mean and standard deviation is calculated for this index and the interdecile range (a measure of uncertainty).
